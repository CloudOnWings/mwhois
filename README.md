mwhois
==================

Multi-Whois is a small whois domain name search program capable of finding multiple available domains via a file or a MySQL query. It's a good way to search for domains that are available to buy. (http://jrosco.github.io/mwhois)


install 
==================

Dependencies:
* Python >= 2.7.3 (Python 3 not supported yet) Download from http://www.python.org/download/
* Python Module wx (can still run mwhois without this module, but only with command line support)

1. Download zip file mwhois.zip https://github.com/jrosco/mwhois/archive/master.zip
2. Unzip mwhois.zip 
3. Windows Only. Ensure that python is in your environment variables e.g C:\Python27 
3. Run run.bat (windows) or run.sh (linux)

Note: For help run 'python mwhois.py --help' via the command line (without quotes). 

how to use
==================

You can either search for a single domain or use a list of names to search for and provide a tld to use e.g .com. A sample file can be found in files/wordlist-sample from the download. To search multiple domains select the "Multi Search" tab and open the file to use, don't worry about selecting a save file this will be done for you, but if you would like to specify a file for saving the the output use the save file function. Now select a tld to use (ATM only a few to choose from) then hit the begin button. Now you'll see all available domains from the wordlist you selected top search.
